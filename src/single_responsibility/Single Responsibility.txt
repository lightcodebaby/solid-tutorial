This principle states that a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

Benefits:
Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
Lower coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
Organization – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic ones.
